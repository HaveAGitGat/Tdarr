                  Tdarr is very much still in development. There's chance
                  something may go wrong between version updates due to changing
                  the way features work and how data is stored/manipulated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If things aren't working as expected, please try restoring
                  from a backup. Else it may be necessary to clear the database
                  using the following button. Your files will not be affected.
                  Please restart Tdarr after doing so.

                  Beta v1.1091 release [24th May 2020]:
          <br />
                  <br />
          All containers are now the same (tdarr, tdarr_aio, tdarr_aio:qsv) and are based on the tdarr_aio:qsv container which
          supports NVENC and QSV hardware transcoding.
          <br />
                  <br />
          tdarr_aio and tdarr_aio:qsv users, you can continue using those containers as normal and will receive updates. You don't need to do anything.
          <br />
                  <br />
          Users who were previously using the tdarr container will need to set up the container again and restore from a backup.
          There is now no need for a separate MongoDB container. Please see the following for help:
